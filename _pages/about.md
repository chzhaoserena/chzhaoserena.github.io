After the National College Entrance Examination, I went to Taiwan for further study. I am now a final-year undergraduate student at Chang Gung University, majored in Biomedical Science. I have been joining research work for 2 years. In the following one year, I will devote to my final-year project. I take great interests in drug research and development, food and nutrition science, herbal and natural medicine.
